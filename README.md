# Credit risk bias detection and mitigation with Amazon SageMaker


## 1. Bias Detection

In this section, we demonstrate a end to end ML use case of credit risk prediction with model explainability and bias detection.

Refer [Bias Detection](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-credit-risk-prediction-explainability-bias-detection/blob/main/explainability-and-bias-detection/README.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions .


## 2. Bias Mitigation

In this section, we demonstrate a end to end ML use case of credit risk prediction with bias mitigation.

Refer [Bias Mitigation](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-credit-risk-prediction-explainability-bias-detection/blob/main/bias-mitigation/README.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions .
