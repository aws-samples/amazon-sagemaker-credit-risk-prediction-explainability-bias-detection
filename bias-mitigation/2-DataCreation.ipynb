    "Synthetic data generation is an effective tool when studying model bias. Data can be biased towards or against specific groups or sub-groups. By generating biased data we can observe how our AI models behave towards a specific group or sub-group. One such sub-group we can examine are Foreign Workers. The model under inspection labels its predictions as 0(Bad credit) or 1(good credit), we can artificially lower their credit worthiness compared to other groups’ through synthetic data generation. \n",
